## Introduction ##

KeyMagic is a front-end IME which aims for the languages that use complex Unicode encoding scripts (Myanmar, Khmer, Vietnamese ...). KeyMagic is used to be fast and light but much features. And supports complex patterns to customize the user inputs as you imagine.

## What can it do? ##

Let's take look at the simplest one.

Assume I want to see **"Thank you very much"** on my screen when I type **"TYVM"**. Yes, KeyMagic can do for me. I may just need to define an expression like below:

` "TTVM" => "Thank you very much" `

How simple is that? Expressions like this one is not actual use of KeyMagic but not limited to, you could do whatever you wanted to! ;D
